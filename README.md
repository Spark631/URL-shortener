Hiya!

This is my python project utilizing the package Sqlite3. I had a lot of fun learning how databases functioned and would love to learn more about them!

Shown above is an overview of how the URL shortener works.

<h1>About the program</h1>


-This program generates a short link from a list of 62 characters, resulting in a possibility of 916132832 unique links

-The links are stored in a Sqlite3 database

-In an event that the program generates a link that is already used, it will generate a new link.

-It can also determine if a link is valid or not
