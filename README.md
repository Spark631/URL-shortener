Hiya!

This is my python project utilizing the package Sqlite3.

Shown above is an overview of how the URL shortener works.

<h1>About the program</h1>


-This program generates a short link from a list of 62 characters.

-This will result in a possibility of 916132832 different links.

-The links are stored in a Sqlite3 database

-In an event that the program generates a link that is already used, it will generate a new link.
